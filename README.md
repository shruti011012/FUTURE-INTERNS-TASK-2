# FUTURE-INTERNS-TASK-2
# Task 2 â€“ ERC-20 Token Development

## Theory  
I learned about smart contracts, token standards (ERC-20), and how blockchain networks execute code. I used that knowledge to build a simple token with Solidity, deploy it, and interact with its functions.

## What I Did  
- Wrote a minimal ERC-20 contract in `FutureToken.sol`.  
- Deployed it using Remix (VM or testnet).  
- Queried the `totalSupply()` function and confirmed correct behavior.  
- Added the contract code and documentation to GitHub.  

## Learnings & Reflection  
- Gained hands-on experience with Solidity and smart contract compilation.  
- Understood deployment flow and how token balances work.  
- Built confidence to write more complex contracts in the future.
